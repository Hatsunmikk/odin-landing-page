# odin-landing-page

This is my first attempt at creating a responsive layout for a landing page using only html and css.
The goal was to understand how css flexbox works.

<br>

This landing page has the following sections:
1. A navbar
2. A hero section
3. An informational section
4. A quote section
5. A call-to-action section
6. A footer

Important takeaways from this project:
1. divs are highly useful. I have used them almost at every point while making this.
2. Planning is important. I realized that before writing out the structure and styling in css, looking at the design and creating a mental plan 
or a mindmap regarding the structure of every portion of the design goes a long way. It not only makes it easy to write the html for it but also
provides a logical base for flexbox to operate from. 
3. This is a continuation of the second point above. A logical html structure finally helped me understand how flexbox works; understanding where to
nest containers to get the desired layout.
4. The thing I struggled the most with was understanding how to make flex-wrap work. It took a fair amount of trial and error to understand that
explicit specification of width and height for any container causes the wrap property to stop working.

In all, this project has been highly productive in terms of understanding flexbox.
Thanks to anyone who's going through this!
